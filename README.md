# Word Count Validator

## Objective

A teacher wants you to design a program to test students' ability to read and count the words in a text.  It should behave similarly to a CAPTCHA, presents a problem then receives a response to the problem which it checks, excpet the problem
in this case is testing students reading/counting skill in the manner described below. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA)

## Description

We want to verify that a client can count words. As such, we need a web service that supplies clients with a "test" and allows the client to submit an answer. If the client and the service were people, their conversation might go something like this:

> **Client**: Service, can you give me some words to count?
> 
> **Service**: Sure. Please count the frequency of the words in "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" but please ignore the words "the" and "dog".
> 
> **Client**: Ok, here are my results: "quick" appeared once, "brown" appeared once, "fox" appeared once, "jumped" appeared once, "over" appeared once, "lazy" appeared once, and "the" appeared twice.
> 
> **Service**: Hmm, looks like some of the counts are not what I'd expect.
> 
> **Client**: Opps, I included "the" when you told me not to. Here are the counts again ... *[omitted]*
> 
> **Service**: Looks great.


## Requirements

Write a server that does 2 things

### 1. Respond to a client HTTP request

Respond to a client HTTP request with at least the following in the response body:

1. A random body of text. Some sample texts are included in the file: texts.tar.gz
2. A list of some but not all words in that body of text (exception: texts with only one unique word should use an empty list)

### 2. Receive a client HTTP request

Receive a client HTTP request with at least the following in the request

1. A body of text
2. A list of some but not all words in that body of text (exception: texts with only one unique word should have an empty list)
3. A count of the frequency of every word in the body of text excluding words from the list

and respond with:

1. If the word frequency count is correct, then `200 OK`
2. If the word frequency count is incorrect or the request is otherwise invalid, then `400 Bad Request`

You are *not* required to write the client application, but you can assume that a client for this server should:

1. Request from 1
2. Count the frequency of each word in the given body of text minus all of the given exclusion words
3. Send to 2 the word frequency count result with the original response body from 1.

### Readme

Writing software in a fast-paced, independent environment involves discovering and resolving many ambiguities. Your ability to make good assumptions and trade-offs is key. Keep the objective of the assignment in mind when making such decisions.
Please include a readme document in your submission that describes any assumptions or decisions.

## Guidelines

1. You should feel free to write your solution in whichever language you are most comfortable writing.
2. Style, algorithms, data structures, request/response format, etc. are all up to you. However, keep in mind that we will be looking at these choices.
2. If your service can run on a Unix environment (e.g. ) Mac OSX, then please include the following:
    1. Any installation instructions or notes to set up our Mac OSX laptops to run your server
    2. A script `./run` to start the server
    3. The server should run on `localhost:8000` and serve a single path `/`
3. If your service _cannot_ run on Mac OSX, then please run your server on a remote host and provide us the hostname, port, and path to access it.

## Bonus

1. **Tests**: You verify that your own service works as expected
3. **Cheating Protection**: When the server receives text, exclusion words, and a word count from the client, it verifies that the text and exclusion words that it previously gave a client.
4. **Stateless/Idempotent**: Remove as much "state" as possible from the server. Any new request to the server does not depend on the state of a previous request.
